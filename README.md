- Implemented a multi-producer multi-consumer circular queue with semaphores
- Implemented futures in different modes to solve producer-consumer problem
- - FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE: One producer and one consumer (1:1)
- - FUTURE_SHARED: One producer and multiple consumers (1:N)
- - FUTURE_QUEUE: multiple producer and multiple consumers (N:N)
- Created a multi-stream processing system
